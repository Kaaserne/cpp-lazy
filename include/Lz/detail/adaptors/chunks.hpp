     * @brief This adaptor is used to make chunks of the iterable, based on chunk size. The iterator
     * category is the same as its input iterable. It returns an iterable of iterables. Its end() function will return a sentinel,
     * if the input iterable has a forward iterator or has a sentinel.
     * If the input iterable is exactly bidirectional and not sized (like `lz::filter` for example), the entire sequence is
     * traversed to get its end size (using `lz::eager_size`); this can be inefficient. To prevent this traversal alltogether, you
     * can use `lz::iter_decay` defined in `<Lz/iter_tools.hpp>` or you can use `lz::cache_size` to cache the size of the
     *iterable. `lz::iter_decay` can decay the iterable into a forward one and since forward iterators cannot go backward, its
     *entire size is therefore also not needed to create an iterator from its end() function. `lz::cache_size` however will
     *traverse the iterable once and cache the size, so that subsequent calls to `end()` will not traverse the iterable again, but
     *will return the cached size instead. The following iterables require a(n) (eagerly)sized iterable:
     * - `lz::chunks`
     * - `lz::enumerate`
     * - `lz::exclude`
     * - `lz::interleave`
     * - `lz::rotate`
     * - `lz::take`
     * - `lz::take_every`
     * - `lz::zip_longest`
     * - `lz::zip`
     *
     * Example:
     * ```cpp
     * std::vector<int> vec = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
     * auto chunked = lz::chunks(vec, 3); // chunked = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5} }
     * // or
     * auto chunked = vec | lz::chunks(3); // chunked = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5} }
     * ```
     * @param iterable The iterable to chunk
     * @param chunk_size The size of the chunks
     * @return An iterable of iterables, where each inner iterable is a chunk of the original iterable
